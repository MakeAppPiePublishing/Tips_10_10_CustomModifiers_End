            Text("""
Port Newmar -  The controversial Orbital Autonomy Act began debate by the Rules subcommittee of the CPJCT this week.  Under the act, while remaining under CPJCT jurisdiction, local affairs and orbital design issues would become the direct responsibility of the Orbital station manager. Station interior design regulations would be removed from CPJCT regulations, along with CPJCT supervision of vendors on the station. Geoffrey Maloney, CEO of Diurnia Salvage and Transport is championing the reforms. "We've been regulating these stations to be completely identical, and they are not able to meet market conditions" said Maloney.  "If, for example market conditions support an art gallery or more restaurants, why shouldn't the station have them? We forbid them now." Opponents want to keep standards for ship crews and station personnel for safety and security reasons.
